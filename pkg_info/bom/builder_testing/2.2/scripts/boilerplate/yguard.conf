# This is a standard Java properties file.
# the two defined properties permit customization of the YGuard obfuscator,
# when scripts are generated by the builder.

# obfuscation defaults to everything; it's controlled by setting what will be
# exposed.  for "package" and "protected-impl" obfuscation style, all classes
# will have some members and fields exposed; for "protected-export" and "public"
# styles, the only exposures are in the packages listed in the export-packages
# list.  If you are using one of the latter two styles, you may want to add
# classes to the list (doing so for the former two styles is pointless, since
# all classes are already in the list).
# This property should be a comma-separated list of class names
# (com.tibco.devtools.builder.AssemblyConstants, for instance).  Do *not*
# use package names; it will not work.
#expose.classes.list=

# Like the expose.classes.list, but this one insures that the classes named will not
# be obfuscated at all.  Same syntax; same restrictions (except that there is
# some use to using this with package and protected-impl styles).
#expose.classes.completely.list=
