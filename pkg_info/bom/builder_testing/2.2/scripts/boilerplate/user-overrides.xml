    <!-- autobuild.dir.java-classes:
            This is the location of the JRE that you want to use to run ant, Eclipse,
            and builder.   The folder specified must contain rt.jar (or the equivalent).
            The default value is very likely to be incorrect, even on Windows. -->
    <property name="autobuild.dir.java-classes"
              location="c:/program files/java/jdk1.5.0/jre/lib" />

    <!-- autobuild.dir.eclipse:
            For 1.2 and later, this should be a bare Eclipse installation.
            For 1.1, modify the first property in the compatibility file.
            This should only refer to eclipse 3.2 (or earlier).
            The default is very likely to be incorrect, even on Windows. -->
    <property name="autobuild.dir.eclipse"
              location="c:/program files/eclipse/3.2" />
    <!-- later versions of eclipse
            Use "-M.m" as the suffix, where M = major version, m = minor version. -->
    <!--property name="autobuild.dir.eclipse-3.3"
              location="" /-->

    <!-- autobuild.dir.user:
            The default location is the directory that contains this file.
            Changing it may be convenient, but is particularly useful for release.
            This is the base directory for most configuration and output. -->
    <property name="autobuild.dir.user"
              location="${user.home}/tibco-build" />

    <!-- autobuild.dir.candidates:
            The output location for build candidates (the output of builder).
            The default value is a folder next to this file, which should be fine for
            most people. -->
    <property name="autobuild.dir.candidates"
              location="${autobuild.dir.user}/candidates" />

    <!-- autobuild.dir.generated.workspaces
            The "workspace" target generates its various folders into this location.
            If you don't like the default, override this setting.  Windows users, for example,
            might choose, location="C:/mydev/workspaces" -->
    <!--property name="autobuild.dir.generated.workspaces"
                 location="${autobuild.dir.user}/workspaces" /-->

    <!-- autobuild.option.eclipse.subversion.client:
         Some people like Subclipse, and some like Subversive.  Proper values for
         this choice are "subclipse" or "subversive".  The default is "subclipse".
         -->
    <!--property name="autobuild.option.eclipse.subversion.client" value="subclipse" /-->
