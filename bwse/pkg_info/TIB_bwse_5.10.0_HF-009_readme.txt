Installation

The installation steps refer to two locations:

- <TIBCO_CONFIG_HOME> is the fully qualified path to the folder that stores
  configuration data generated by TIBCO products.

All Platforms:
Follow the steps in scenario 1 or 2 as appropriate.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scenario 1: Steps for applying the hotfix to a new installation of
the above products are as follows.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Follow the installation instructions for the applicable products.
   Ensure that the installation profile is selected. In the last panel 
   of the installer,  clear the check box "Run TIBCO Configuration 
   Tool", if it is  present.

2. Extract the hotfix archive file to a temporary directory different
   from where the product installer archive was extracted.

3. Download TIBCO Universal Installer 3.1.0 V5 from the TIBCO Support
   server ftp://support-ftp.tibco.com to the same temporary directory as
   step 2.

   NOTE: Universal Installer 3.1.0 V5 does not support the Console mode; 
              the GUI or Silent mode should be used instead.

4. Navigate to the temporary directory where the hotfix archive file was
   extracted.

5. Invoke the TIBCO Universal Installer, selecting an existing <TIBCO_HOME>.

6. If the installation profile selected in step 1 included Runtime Host 
   or Administration, run TIBCO Configuration Tool from
   <TIBCO_HOME>/tct/1.2.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scenario 2: Steps for applying the hotfix to an existing installation of the
above products are as follows.

NOTE: The hotfix automatically applies to only the new nodes that are
created after the installation of the hotfix. To apply the hotfix to existing
instances, perform the following steps.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Shut down all TIBCO Host instances. If you have replicated the TIBCO
   ActiveMatrix Administrator servers, do not stop all servers at once while
   upgrading. Stop only the one you are upgrading.

2. Repeat the steps 3-8 for all machines in the TIBCO ActiveMatrix enterprise:

   a. First, on each machine on which TIBCO ActiveMatrix Administrator server
      is running
   b. On each machine running one or more TIBCO Host instances

3. Extract the hotfix archive file to a temporary directory.

4. Download TIBCO Universal Installer 3.1.0 V5 from the TIBCO Support 
    FTP server ftp://support-ftp.tibco.com to the same temporary directory as
    step 3.

   NOTE: Universal Installer 3.1.0 V5 does not the support Console mode; 
              the GUI or Silent mode should be used instead.

5. Navigate to the same temporary directory where the hotfix archive was
   extracted.

6. Invoke the TIBCO Universal Installer, selecting the existing <TIBCO_HOME>
   to which the hotfix needs to be applied.

7. Open a terminal window and change to "<TIBCO_HOME>/amx/3.2/bin".

8. For the TIBCO Host instance that you want to update:

   a. Run this command:
      "tibamx_patchmgr applyPatch -configHomeLocation <TIBCO_CONFIG_HOME>
      -instanceName <instanceName> -ID bwse.patch:5.10.0.HF9"

   b. Restart the TIBCO Host instances.

When you view a node to which this patch has been applied in the TIBCO Administrator
UI, some of the feature versions displayed under "Infrastructure > Nodes >
Configuration > Features" or "Infrastructure > Software Management >
Features" does not reflect the latest versions of the features installed with
the hotfix. The inconsistency is expected. Do not perform any actions on the
node to correct it.

To determine the patch level of all the nodes managed by a TIBCO host instance,
use the "describeAppliedPatches" command in tibamx_patchmgr.

Run "tibamx_patchmgr intro" and "tibamx_patchmgr help" for more details on the
tool.
================================================================================
Uninstallation
 
TIBCO Business Studio does not support uninstalling a hotfix. To roll 
back to the previous version of TIBCO Business Studio, reinstall the previous 
version of the product in a new installation environment and select the 
SOA Development profile.

To uninstall the hotfix, follow these steps:

1.  Stop the TIBCO Host instance processes, node processes, and TIBCO Business Studio.

2.  Open a command window and change to "<TIBCO_HOME>/amx/3.2/bin".

3.  Run "tibamx_patchmgr revertPatch -configHomeLocation <TIBCO_CONFIG_HOME>
    -instanceName <HostInstanceName> -ID bwse.patch:5.10.0.HF9"

    NOTE: You cannot revert a patch on a TIBCO Host instance if you
    have created any new nodes on that instance since applying
    the patch.

4. In <TIBCO_HOME>/tools/universal_installer/, run TIBCOUniversalInstaller.
   Note that the TIBCO Universal Installer version 3.1.0 V5 must be used; the
   executable in this directory has been updated to version 3.1.0 V5 assuming 
   that this version was used when installing the hotfix as described earlier.

5. In the TIBCO Installation Manager, select Uninstall Products from the selected 
   TIBCO Home Location, click Next, and then click Next on the Welcome screen.

6. Select Custom Uninstall (the only correct option) and click Next.  

7. Select the check boxes next to the following names of products that comprise
   the hotfix to uninstall: 
   - TIBCO ActiveMatrix BusinessWorks Service Engine 5.10.0 Hotfix-009 

8. Click Next and then click Uninstall.

9. In the summary screen, click Finish to exit the uninstall wizard.
